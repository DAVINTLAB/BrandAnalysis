# Integrated Visual Analysis for Brand Perception on Different Social Networks

Nowadays, social media fosters billions of users and has become an important communication source. Social media empowered the users' opinions supplying quick and less costly feedback compared to traditional survey methods. However, analyzing a brand through its social media is not trivial and raises challenges. To benefit from its data, brands need easy-to-use tools to help them understand the data gathered. Thus, the main goal of this work is to provide a visual analysis approach composed of several interactive visualization techniques to support brands to obtain insights from their social media. Besides the analyses allowed by integrating different social media data, the proposed approach has a well-defined pipeline that can be extended and used without programming knowledge. We conducted two case studies to explore these analyses, one for Netflix and one for Amazon Prime Video data. The results help us to highlight the approach's potential and possible future investigations.
